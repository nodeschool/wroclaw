# Installing NodeJS on Mac OS X

The easiest way is to use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). It is just one command in terminal to install `brew` across the system:
```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then installing NodeJS is a piece of cake:
```
$ brew install node
```

## Running NodeJS in terminal

To confirm that everything is working properly you should be able to type just
```
$ node
```

and see the prompt. You can interactively run JavaScript here.
